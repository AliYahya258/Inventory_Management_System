# üßæ Inventory Tracking System ‚Äì Case Study (Bazaar Challenge)

Welcome! This project is a backend service designed to track product inventory and stock movements, starting from a single kiryana store and scaling up to support thousands of stores with real-time updates, audit logs, and caching.

---

## üöÄ Project Summary

This system manages product inventory across multiple stores, enabling:

- Real-time stock visibility per store and product
- Logging of all stock movements (IN, OUT, REMOVED)
- Asynchronous updates and rate limiting
- Redis-backed caching for scalability
- Audit logs to trace every action
- RESTful API design with secure access

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

### Entity Relationships

- `Store`: Represents a kiryana store.
- `Product`: Central catalog of all products.
- `Inventory`: Junction table linking a product to a store with its current quantity.
- `StockMovement`: Logs each change in inventory with type, date, and quantity.

### Evolution Path

#### ‚úÖ **v1: MVP (Single Store)**
- PostgreSQL used for local persistence
- Basic REST APIs to log and view stock
- Inventory table links store to product

#### ‚úÖ **v2: Multi-store Support**
- Stores are dynamically managed
- Product catalog is shared across stores
- APIs support filtering by store and date range
- Basic authentication in place

#### ‚úÖ **v3: Scalable System**
- Redis added for caching
- Async service methods using `@Async`
- Bucket4j-based rate limiting per IP
- Audit logs written for every movement
- Caching used to reduce DB load

---

## üîê Security Features

- Basic Authentication is enforced for all APIs.
- Bucket4j limits each IP to **10 requests/minute (can be modified as per need)** to prevent abuse.

## üìÇ API Endpoint Reference


### üåê Base URL

When running locally, all API requests should be made to:

http://localhost:8081


Example:
(GET http://localhost:8081/api/products)


Make sure the server is running on port `8081`. If you've changed it, update your request URLs accordingly.
